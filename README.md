Pashto Text &amp; Graphics 
Layout analysis is the main component of a typical Document Image Analysis (DIA) system and performs an important role in pre-processing. However, regarding the Pashto language, the document images are not explored so far. Therefore, here is a notable contribution regarding the creation of a real dataset. The dataset contains more than 1,000 images of the Pashto documents captured by a camera. The dataset we applied the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) following a deep learning technique. Our intended method is based on the development of the advanced and classical variant of Faster R-CNN called Single-Shot Detector (SSD). The evaluation was done by examining the 300 images from the test set. In this way, We achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 84.90%
